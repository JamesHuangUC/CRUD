# CRUD

Designed a Node.js web application that uses RESTful web services and supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, user authentication and authorization.

I also created a [Ruby on Rails version of this application](https://github.com/JamesHuangUC/Ruby-on-Rails-CRUD).

    backend: [express, nodejs],
    database: [postgresql, sequelize]
}
```


# Run in Docker

```
docker-compose up -d # Start the app with one command.

# Check it out in localhost:3000
